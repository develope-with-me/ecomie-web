# 🎉 Vite Migration Complete!

ECOMIE web application has been successfully migrated from Create React App (CRA) with CRACO to Vite. Here's what was accomplished:

### ✅ Changes Made:

1. Package.json Updates:
   *  Updated scripts to use Vite instead of CRACO (npm start, npm run build, etc.)
   *  Replaced react-scripts and @craco/craco with Vite and Vitest
   *  Added modern Vite dependencies: @vitejs/plugin-react-swc, vitest, jsdom
   *  Removed CRA-specific configurations (eslintConfig, browserslist)
2. Configuration Files:
   *  Vite Config (vite.config.ts): Configured with React plugin, proxy settings for your API, path aliases, and test setup
   *  TypeScript Config: Updated for modern ES modules and Vite compatibility
   *  HTML Template: Moved from public/index.html to root index.html with Vite structure
3. File Cleanup:
   *  Removed craco.config.js
   *  Removed old CRA public/index.html
   *  Updated .gitignore to include Vite build directory (/dist)
4. Testing Setup:
   * Migrated from Jest to Vitest
   * Configured with jsdom environment for DOM testing
   * Updated test files to work with Vite

### ✅ Key Features Preserved:

* ✅ Proxy Configuration: API calls to http://107.21.67.222 still work
* ✅ Path Aliases: @/ imports continue to work
* ✅ Styling: All CSS, SCSS, and Tailwind configurations maintained
* ✅ TypeScript: Full TypeScript support with improved module resolution
* ✅ Development Tools: Hot module replacement and fast refresh
* ✅ Internationalization: i18n setup preserved
* ✅ All UI Libraries: Radix UI, Material-UI, and other components unchanged

✅ Available Commands: 
#### `npm start`      # Start development server (Vite)
#### `npm run dev`    # Alternative development server command
#### `npm run build`  # Build for production
#### `npm run preview` # Preview production build
#### `npm test`       # Run tests with Vitest
#### `npm run lint`   # ESLint

### 🚀 Benefits of the Migration:

1. Faster Development: Vite's dev server starts much faster than CRA
2. Better HMR: Near-instantaneous hot module replacement
3. Smaller Bundle: Better tree shaking and optimizations
4. Modern Tooling: Latest ESBuild and Rollup integration
5. Flexible Configuration: No more ejecting needed for customizations

### 📝 Next Steps:

1. Test the Application: Run npm start and verify everything works
2. Update CI/CD: Update any deployment scripts to use npm run build instead of CRA commands
3. Team Migration: Update any documentation for the new commands
4. Environment Variables: Vite uses VITE_ prefix for public env vars (if needed)
